# RLTuple : Automatically Tuning Tuple Space Partitioning for Scalable Packet Classification using Deep Reinforcement Learning
## Introduction
RLTuple is a deep reinforcement learning(DRL) approach to solve the packet classification problem, which automatically tunes tuple space partitioning and adapts to rulesets with various characteristics. RLTuple can process rulesets generated by ClassBench/ClassBench-ng, and generating packet traces for testing.\
Additionally, an implementation for PartitionSort, Tuple Space Search, DynamicTuple, HybridTSS, TupleMerge are included for comparing with our method. If there are any problems or bugs, welcome to discuss with me(lanan@buaa.edu.cn).
## Experimental environment
g++.exe (GCC) 9.2.0\
python 3.6.6\
tensorflow 1.12.0\
keras 2.1.6
## Parameters
f : input ruleset\
a : optimize aim(throughput/delay)\
c : algorithms to test(PSTSS,TupleMerge,PartitionSort,DynamicTuple,RLTuple,HybridTSS)\
d : whether to consider the distribution of packet traces\
to : tradeoff between lookup/update throughput(only take effect when parameter a=throughput)\
n : number of trials\
p : packet traces
## example
runing the RLTuple environment:\
./main f=acl4_seed_1000_12 a=throughput c=TupleMerge,RLTuple d=yes to=0 n=3 p=acl4_seed_1000_12_traces\
runing the RLTuple agent:\
python ./RL/train.py
