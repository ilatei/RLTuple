# tuplemerge
Reference implementation for the TupleMerge packet classifier
Additionally, an implementation for PartitionSort and Tuple Space Search are included.
Both offline and online implementations of TM and PS are provided (TSS is online only).
The program can run each algorithm in sequence.

TupleMerge is able to read files generated by the ClassBench packet classifier.

A sample rule list and trace file have been included.

A sample bash script, test.sh, has been provided that demonstrates running all of the algorithms on a given rule list and packet trace, as well as for setting TupleMerge's collision limit parameter.
